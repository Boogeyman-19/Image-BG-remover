# Image Background Remover with Random Color Background

This Python script removes the background from an image and replaces it with a randomly generated color background. The script uses the `rembg` library for background removal, `easygui` for file dialogs, and `PIL` (Pillow) for image processing.

## Features

- **Background Removal**: Removes the existing background from the input image using the `rembg` library.
- **Random Background Color**: Replaces the removed background with a randomly generated color.
- **File Dialogs**: Uses `easygui` to select the input image and specify the output file path.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- `rembg`
- `easygui`
- `Pillow`

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install rembg easygui pillow
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using the command below:

   ```bash
   python image.py
   ```

2. **Select Input Image**: A file dialog will appear prompting you to select the image file from which you want to remove the background.

3. **Choose Output Path**: Another file dialog will prompt you to choose where to save the final image with the new background.

4. **Process Image**: The script will process the image by removing the background and adding a randomly generated color background.

5. **Save Image**: The processed image will be saved to the specified location.

## How It Works

1. **Image Selection**: The script opens a file dialog to select the input image file.
2. **Background Removal**: The `rembg` library removes the background from the selected image.
3. **Random Background Color**: A new background with a random color is created using the `Pillow` library.
4. **Image Saving**: The final image, with the new background, is saved to the chosen location.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how the script works:

1. **Select Image**: Choose an image with a background that you want to remove.
2. **Choose Output Location**: Specify where you want to save the processed image.
3. **Result**: The script generates an image with the background removed and replaced with a random color background.
